task: >
  You have been given 18S rRNA amplicon data from marine sediments. Using the METASEED pipeline,
  reconstruct full-length rRNA sequences and answer the following:

questions:
  - id: q1
    stage: quality_control
    text: "How many reads remained after adapter trimming?"
    answer_type: integer_exact

  - id: q2
    stage: assembly
    text: "How many contigs were assembled from the reads?"
    answer_type: integer_exact

  - id: q3
    stage: alignment
    text: "What was the average alignment identity (%) of the assembled rRNA contigs?"
    answer_type: numeric_percent
    tolerance: 0.5

  - id: q4
    stage: reconstruction
    text: "How many full-length 18S rRNA genes were reconstructed?"
    answer_type: integer_exact

  - id: q5
    stage: annotation
    text: "Which genus was most abundant among the reconstructed rRNA genes?"
    answer_type: string_exact
